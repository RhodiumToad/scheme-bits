Scheme bits
===========

What's here is not any kind of organized collection of libraries, but
just more or less random fragments of code that might be of interest
to someone.

In general they will have been written for Guile, portability is
likely to be somewhat variable.

They can be used freely (with credit) with NO WARRANTY under the MIT
license, or relicensed according to the terms in RELICENSE.txt where
applicable.
